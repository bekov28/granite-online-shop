**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript (Vue.js), Bootstrap for styling, Firebase for backend, Cloudinary for image upload, Pinia for State Management

## Lessons Learned:
Gained practical skills on Application develepment with Vue.js and enhanced my knowledge on Pinia State Management, a new version of Vuex (state management for Vue 2).

Moreover, I was able to explore Firebase and was amazed by its simplicity and novelty. The project also includes Admin user who is only able to update and add products to prevent abuse cases. 

Also, I learned quite a lot of things while working on Authentification and Authorization part of the project. Most difficult part of the project that I struggled, but managed to build was to keep the persistance of Pinia State, however, it was a valuable experience to work on it.
